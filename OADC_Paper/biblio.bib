abstract = {Abstract The cause of intraplate seismic zones persists as an important scientific and societal question. Most intraplate earthquakes are concentrated in specific seismic zones along or adjacent to large-scale basement structures (e.g., rifts or sutures at ancient plate boundaries) within continental crust. The major intraplate seismic zones are limited to specific segments and are not distributed along the lengths of the ancient structures. We present a new hypothesis that major intraplate seismic zones are restricted to places where concentrated crustal deformation (CCD) is overprinted on large-scale basement structures. Examples where CCD affects the stability of specific parts of large-scale structures in response to present-day stress conditions include the most active seismic zones in central and eastern North America: Charlevoix, Eastern Tennessee, and New Madrid. Our hypothesis has important implications for the assessment of seismic hazards.}

We investigate this hypothesis on earth by examining whether terrestrial impact structures show higher rates of nearby earthquake activity than do surrounding intraplate regions. For 28 of 30 probable impact structures having an original crater 20 km or more in diameter, the rates of nearby seismicity have been no higher than the regional background rates. For two large probable impact structures, Vredefort and Charlevoix, with higher than normal rates of nearby seismicity, factors other than slip on impact-induced faults appear to control the occurrence of earthquakes. We conclude that impact-induced faults, at least on earth, do not persist as lithospheric “weak zones” for periods in excess of several million years after the impact event.}

abstract = {Abstract— On the basis of detailed field investigations and the study of impact breccias at the Charlevoix impact structure (Québec), a structural analysis is given. This analysis shows that the annular arrangement of both topography and lithology can be applied to subdivide the two craters discussed in this review. Successive rings characterize the central uplift and its collapsed ring graben in the Charlevoix structure. Fault breccias show an annular distribution and indicate diverse directions of movement suggesting progressive readjustment. They formed cohesionless products inside fault planes, named mylolisthenite, and are believed to have acted as lubricants during the modification stage of the formation of the structure: listric readjustment by gravity after the formation of the transient crater. The Sudbury Structure (Ontario) shows fault breccias in a concentric arrangement similar to that of Charlevoix. It may be compared with the Charlevoix structure by applying the same mechanical readjustment model with deep listric faults. The only difference is the amount of the rise structural uplift, that is, the height of central uplift, which is less important in the larger impact structure.}

abstract = {We use a two-dimensional finite difference computer program to study the effect of fault steps on dynamic ruptures. Our results indicate that a strike-slip earthquake is unlikely to jump a fault step wider than 5 km, in correlation with field observations of moderate to great-sized earthquakes. We also find that dynamically propagating ruptures can jump both compressional and dilational fault steps, although wider dilational fault steps can be jumped. Dilational steps tend to delay the rupture for a longer time than compressional steps do. This delay leads to a slower apparent rupture velocity in the vicinity of dilational steps. These “dry” cases assumed hydrostatic or greater pore-pressures but did not include the effects of changing pore pressures. In an additional study, we simulated the dynamic effects of a fault rupture on ‘undrained’ pore fluids to test Sibson's (1985, 1986) suggestion that “wet” dilational steps are a barrier to rupture propagation. Our numerical results validate Sibson's hypothesis by demonstrating that the effect of the rupture on the ‘undrained’ pore fluids is to inhibit the rupture from jumping dilational stepovers. The basis of our result differs from Sibson's hypothesis in that our model is purely elastic and does not necessitate the opening of extension fractures between the fault segments.}

abstract = {This paper discusses Coulomb failure criteria for brittle deformation of intact rock and fault gouge. Data are presented from laboratory experiments designed to identify the critical gouge layer thickness required to effect a transition from the standard Coulomb criterion to a modified failure law (referred to as Coulomb plasticity) appropriate for simple shear of a gouge layer. Experiments were carried out using tension fractures and quartz powder to simulate granular fault gouge. Fractures sheared without gouge obey the standard Coulomb law. A 0.6mm-thick gouge layer was required to effect the transition to Coulomb plasticity. I test and reject the hypothesis that fault zone strength and apparent coefficient of internal friction can be predicted from fracture of intact rock simply by accounting for differences in the failure laws and without considering variations in the Coulomb parameters. The data presented indicate that the stress state required for Coulomb plasticity is not developed within very thin gouge layers. This work implies that brittle fault zones have lower friction than predictions based on the strength of intact rock. However, the magnitude of this weakening effect is small (for example, a coefficient of sliding friction of 0.75 would be reduced to 0.6) and thus it is not an independent explanation of the apparent weakness of mature faults.}

abstract = {We present Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements that constrain the amplitude, pattern, and origin of crustal deformation in the Saint Lawrence valley, Québec, one of the most seismically active regions of eastern North America. The GPS network shows coherent southeastward motion of 0.6 ± 0.2 mm yr−1, relative to North America, and uplift of 2.6 ± 0.4 mm yr−1. Network average horizontal strain rates are mostly ESE-WNW shortening at (1.7 ± 1.0) × 10−9 yr−1. The shortening rate across the Charlevoix seismic zone is about twice as big as the regional average. These measurements are consistent with both postglacial rebound (PGR) models and the deformation style indicated by earthquake focal mechanisms. Although the GPS data do not discriminate between various models of crustal deformation, they provide important constraints on large earthquake recurrence. Assuming that the GPS strain estimates are representative of seismic moment release, they constrain the maximum magnitude of truncated Gutenberg-Richter recurrence statistics in the Charlevoix seismic zone to MX = 7.8 ± 0.6 (one M ≥ 7 earthquake per 400–1300 years). The remarkable agreement between the GPS strain rates, seismic catalogue statistics, and PGR predictions suggests that in Charlevoix, most of the PGR-driven crustal strain may be released by large (M ≥ 7) earthquakes. In the rest of the Saint Lawrence valley, PGR strain rates are significantly larger than seismic strain rates, suggesting either that PGR deformation remains mostly elastic or that large events are more frequent than indicated by small earthquake statistics (i.e., characteristic earthquakes).}

Previous attempts have been made to study this earthquake using modern waveform analysis techniques, but the source parameters could be only partially constrained due to a lack of good data. Recently, a number of seismograms that had not been previously studied were rediscovered, warranting a second look at the earthquake. The best overall solution is strike 42° ± 7°, dip 53° ± 7°, rake 105° ± 10°, depth 10 km, seismic moment 3.1 ± 2.5 × 1025 dyne cm (MW 6.2), MS 6.2 ± 0.3, mb 6.5 ± 0.4, source duration 5 sec, and stress drop 35 bars.

Using ground-motion attenuation relations and the threshold for chimney and masonry damage from fragility curves for seventeenth- and eighteenth-century dwellings in Boston, the magnitude of the 1663 earthquake is at least M 6.9 if the damage occurred on very soft soil conditions and is M 7.3 to M 7.7 if the damage took place on firm soil or bedrock.

Also, in the 1811–1812 New Madrid earthquake sequence only the 7 February 1812 shock, the largest of the sequence, caused chimney damage beyond about 600 km. The 7 February New Madrid event is thought to have taken place on the Reelfoot fault, for which the length of the recent earthquake activity and of the suspected 1812 rupture is less than that of the active seismicity zone at Charlevoix.
