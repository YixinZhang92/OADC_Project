Landers_*D.mat files contain the locations of 3360 aftershocks recorded after the 1992 M7.3 Landers earthquake. The 2D version is a surface projection (epicenters) and the covariance information for each event is expressed with with 3 variables: cov(xx), cov(yy) and cov(xy). For the 3D version the covariance is given with 6 elements cov(xx),cov(yy),cov(zz),cov(xy),cov(xz) and cov(yz).
Detailed description of the dataset is given in the following reference.
